# PHP ePub generator

PHPePub allows a php script to generate ePub Electronic books on the fly, and send them to the user as downloads.

PHPePub support most of the ePub 2.01 specification, and enough of the new ePub3 specification to make valid ePub 3 books as well.

PHPePub is meant to be easy to use for small projects, and still allow for comples and complete e-books should the need arise.

The Zip.php class in this project originates from Github: git://github.com/Grandt/PHPZip.git

See the examples for example usage. The php files have "some" doumentation in them in the form of Javadoc style function headers.
